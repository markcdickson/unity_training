  storyText: 'That morning was the beginning of the end for the two of you.


    Your inability to own up to your mistakes and potentially fix them adds up over
    time. What begins as a lackluster breakfast becomes missed dinner dates and leaving
    parties on your own.


    A blatent disregard for the other person''s feelings shines through in your day-to-day
    activities more than you know.


    Buck up and do better next time.


    1. End'
