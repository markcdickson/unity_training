  storyText: "You stride into the kitchen, still slightly blurry, and stumble over
    to the fridge to see what you managed to pick up last night.\r\n\r\nYou see all
    of the staples: bacon, sausages, eggs, milk, bread, hash browns, backed beans,
    mushrooms, tomatoes. You can even spot some cereal sitting on top of one of the
    cupboards nearby.\r\n\r\nYou know that you don't have much time to placate the
    bubbling discontent that you left back in the bedroom.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Get started immediately on breakfast\r\n2. Make a quick cup of coffee and bring
    it back to the bedroom."
