  storyText: "You pick up the knife that you previously discarded and painstakingly
    turn each rasher onto its slide and slice through it. Although you have an exceedingly
    sharp knife, there are a few times when you begin to saw - desperate to get this
    done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter ten minutes, you finally finish and the
    pile next to you looks too big.\r\n\r\nThis was a bad idea.\r What do you do next?\r\n\r\n1.
    Chuck it in the shallow frying pan and focus on the pancakes\r\n2. Carefully cook
    the bacon in batches and then focus on the pancakes"
