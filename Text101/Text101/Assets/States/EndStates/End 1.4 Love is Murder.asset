  storyText: 'As the fire surrounds you, you refuse to move, oddly resigned to your
    fate.


    As you see the flames start to lick around your feet, you''re reminded of that
    dream you had last night. You''re afraid, but oddly forlorn.


    You don''t scream; you worship the flame.


    1. End'
